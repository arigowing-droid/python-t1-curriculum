# comparison operators compare values and return True or False
print(5 > 3) # greater than
print(7 > 2) # Less than
print(5 >= 5) # greater than or equal to
print( 4 <= 4)  # less than or equal to
print( 7 == 7)  # Equal to (double equals, not single)
print(5 != 3)  # Not equal to

# You can compare variables as well:
a = 10
b = 7
print(a > b)
print(a == b)
